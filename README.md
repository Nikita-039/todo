This is a full-stack Todo web application built using Next.js (App Router) for the frontend and Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for the backend. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete todos with a clean and responsive UI. When a user clicks the "+ TODO" button, a new task is created in the database with a title, description, and timestamp. All todos are displayed on the left with pagination (10 todos per page), and clicking on any item loads its details on the right panel. The user can then update the title or description, and changes are saved in real-time to the database. The project uses minimal client-side rendering and is optimized for performance.
To run the project locally, you need to start both the frontend and backend servers. First, navigate to the backend folder, install dependencies using npm install, and create a .env file with your MongoDB connection string. Then start the backend with node index.js. Next, go to the frontend folder, run npm install, and start the development server with npm run dev. Once both servers are running, you can open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
